### Aim and Scope of Neurosurgery​ Practice
Neurosurgery Practice is the official data science publication of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Neurosurgery Practice with code provides a medium for the prompt publication of scientific articles dealing with the application of computer science, data science, augmented reality, or other technologies of interest to neurosurgeons.

### Submissio​n Preparation: Neurosurgery Article Types
​ NOTE: All submissions undergo a "Technical Check" to confirm their adherence to Journal standards. If your submission is not formatted correctly, it will be returned for corrections, delaying peer review. Please format your submission correctly to ensure timely processing. Additional submission preparation information is available in the Neurosurgery Publications Instructions for Authors.​​

### FULL LENGTH ARTICLE TYPES
These article types cover a range of topics from neurosurgery. The information and data presented in these studies should be based on original research.​​​

#### Data Science Research
These articles represent a substantial body of computational research involving human subjects or basic science. The objective should be well defined, and the methodology should involve the use of computational software that is well described the evidence presented should be original and the discussion should be based on the data and computational results. Ethical standards must be met for both human and cadaveric subjects, with the approval of institutional research board (IRB) and appropriate consents.
